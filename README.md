# Solar MAgnetic Connection Haus tool

Adapted from <https://github.com/esdc-esac-esa-int/Solar-MACH> and modified to run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).

## Running through Google Colab
1. Copy this repository folder `Solar-MACH` to your base directory of Google Drive
2. Open <https://colab.research.google.com/github/jgieseler/Solar-MACH/blob/master/flare_sketch.ipynb> in your web browser
3. If needed while running the 1st cell connect Google Drive to Google Colab - just follow the instructions (needed to access `.py` file from repository that is after step 1 also on your Google Drive).
4. If needed uncomment 3rd cell to install missing packages with `!pip install package`
5. Run all remaining cells.
